# Assignment 1 — Matching Pennies (WSLS vs k-ToM-inspired belief learning)

This folder contains Assignment 1 for Advanced Cognitive Modelling.

The assignment formalises two strategies for repeated Matching Pennies (with a mid-game role swap):

1. **Win–Stay / Lose–Shift (WSLS)**
2. **k-ToM-inspired belief learning** (belief update + role-dependent action mapping, with noise)

The workflow includes simulation (tournament + role-swap dynamics) and model fitting (Stan + LOO) to show that the strategies are mechanistic and distinguishable.
