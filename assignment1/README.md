# Assignment 1 — Matching Pennies (WSLS vs k-ToM-inspired belief learning)

This repository contains Assignment 1 for Advanced Cognitive Modelling.

The assignment documents and formalises two strategies for repeated Matching Pennies (with a mid-game role swap):  
1) Win–Stay / Lose–Shift (WSLS)  
2) k-ToM-inspired belief learning (simple opponent-belief update + role-dependent action mapping)

The project includes simulation results (tournament performance, role-swap dynamics) and a model-fitting section (Stan + LOO comparison) to show that the strategies are mechanistic and distinguishable.
