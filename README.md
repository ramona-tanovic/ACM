# ACM — Advanced Cognitive Modelling

This repository contains my course work for **Advanced Cognitive Modelling (ACM)** and is organised as two self-contained assignment folders:

- `assignment1/` — Formalising and simulating strategies for repeated Matching Pennies (WSLS vs k-ToM-inspired belief learning), plus Stan fitting + LOO comparison.
- `assignment2/` — Model fitting workflow (single-agent WSLS policy model + optional multilevel extension), including prior/posterior predictive checks and parameter recovery.
