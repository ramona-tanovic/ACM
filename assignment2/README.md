# Assignment 2 — Stan cognitive model for Matching Pennies

Goal: build and validate a cognitive model of Matching Pennies behaviour in **Stan**.
Plan:
- define the model (likelihood + parameters + priors),
- include a **Stan model**,
- assess **model quality** (prior predictive, posterior predictive, prior→posterior update, sampling diagnostics),
- run **parameter recovery** (why/how; how many trials are needed; role of priors),
- (optional) multilevel model and/or empirical dataset.
