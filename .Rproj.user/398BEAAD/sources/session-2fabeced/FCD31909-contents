# Advanced Cognitive Modeling (ACM)

This repository contains my coursework for the Advanced Cognitive Modeling course.
Each assignment lives in its own folder (e.g., `assignment1/`) with code + a Quarto report.

## Reproducible setup (recommended: renv)

If you use `renv` for the whole repo:

```r
install.packages("renv")
renv::restore()
```

When you add packages:

```r
renv::snapshot()
```

Do **not** commit `renv/library/`.

## Stan / cmdstanr

Assignment 1 uses **Stan via cmdstanr** for two things:
1) sampling strategy parameters (priors) used by the tournament
2) fitting a simple policy model to generated choice sequences

Install cmdstanr:

```r
install.packages("cmdstanr", repos = c("https://mc-stan.org/r-packages/", getOption("repos")))
```

Install CmdStan once:

```r
cmdstanr::install_cmdstan()
```

## Run Assignment 1

From the repo root:

```r
setwd("assignment1")
source("run_all.R")
```
