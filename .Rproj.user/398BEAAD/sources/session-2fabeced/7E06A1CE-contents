# Advanced Cognitive Modelling — Assignment 1

This repository contains a complete, reproducible pipeline for Assignment 1 (Matching Pennies) from the **Advanced Cognitive Modelling** course.

The assignment deliverables are:
1) A short written document (here: `assignment1/assignment1.qmd`, renderable to HTML) describing **two strategies**, their **cognitive constraints**, and **plots** comparing them.
2) A version-controlled repository with **all code** for simulation and visualization.

Repository layout
- `assignment1/` — everything for Assignment 1
  - `assignment1.qmd` — the document
  - `run_all.R` — runs simulations + Stan fits + figures
  - `R/` — helper functions
  - `stan/` — Stan models (priors + hierarchical fits)
  - `outputs/` — generated figures and data

## Using renv (recommended)

If you use `renv`, place your `renv.lock` in the repo root (next to `ACM.Rproj`). Then from RStudio:

- `renv::restore()`

If you don’t have a lockfile yet:

- `renv::init()`
- run `assignment1/run_all.R` once (it will tell you if packages are missing)
- `renv::snapshot()`

## CmdStan / cmdstanr

This project uses `cmdstanr`, so you need CmdStan installed.

In RStudio:
- `cmdstanr::install_cmdstan()`

Then you can run the pipeline.

## Run Assignment 1

Open `ACM.Rproj`, then open `assignment1/run_all.R` and click **Source**.

Outputs:
- Figures: `assignment1/outputs/figs/`
- Data: `assignment1/outputs/data/`
