# Assignment 1 — Matching Pennies: two strategies + cognitive interpretation

What you must hand in (per the assignment brief)
1) A short document (Google Doc / Word / etc.) that:
- describes **two strategies** for Matching Pennies
- discusses **cognitive constraints** (memory limits, perseveration, errors)
- includes a **diagram** formalising each strategy
- includes **plots** showing how strategies fare against each other + a brief interpretation
- includes a link to your GitHub/GitLab repository

2) A version-control repository that contains all code to:
- implement the strategies
- simulate repeated games (with a mid-game role swap)
- create the plots used in the document

What this repo gives you
- Two strategies:
  - `WSLS` (Win–Stay / Lose–Shift)
  - `kToM` (interpretable belief learning + noisy best response)
- A fully reproducible simulation pipeline with 4 figures:
  - Fig 1: matchup performance with bootstrap intervals
  - Fig 2: role sensitivity (Matcher advantage)
  - Fig 3: interpretation plot (repeat-after-win/loss signature)
  - Fig 4: payoff distributions

Folder map
- `run_all.R` : runs everything end-to-end
- `assignment1.qmd` : report template you can render (HTML) and copy into your doc
- `R/` : simulation + plotting functions (heavily commented)
- `outputs/` : created automatically when you run the pipeline

Prerequisites
1) R (>= 4.2). RStudio is optional but convenient.
2) Quarto (optional): only needed if you want to render `assignment1.qmd`.

renv (recommended)
- If you already have a `renv.lock` in the repo root (same level as `ACM.Rproj`), run:
  - `renv::restore()`

- If you do not have a lockfile yet:
  - `renv::init()`
  - install packages (see `R/dependencies.R`)
  - `renv::snapshot()`

Run everything
From the repository root (terminal):
- `Rscript assignment1/run_all.R`

Or from RStudio:
- open `assignment1/run_all.R` and click “Source”.

Outputs
- `assignment1/outputs/data/`:
  - `matches.csv` (match-level outcomes)
  - `players.csv` (player-level diagnostics for interpretation)
  - summary tables used for the plots
- `assignment1/outputs/figs/`:
  - `fig1_matchups.png`
  - `fig2_role_advantage.png`
  - `fig3_repeat_signature.png`
  - `fig4_payoff_distribution.png`

Render the report (optional)
From `assignment1/`:
- `quarto render assignment1.qmd`
