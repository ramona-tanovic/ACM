# Advanced Cognitive Modeling (ACM) — course repo

This repository contains my coursework for the Advanced Cognitive Modeling course.  
Each assignment lives in its own folder (e.g., `assignment1/`) with its own code and Quarto report.

## Requirements

- R (recent version) and RStudio are recommended.
- Quarto is required only if you want to render `.qmd` reports to HTML/PDF (the simulations/plots can still run without rendering).

## Reproducible setup (recommended: `renv`)

This repo uses `renv` to capture the R package versions in `renv.lock`.

After cloning the repo and opening `ACM.Rproj` in RStudio:

```r
install.packages("renv")
renv::restore()
```

When you install new packages during the course, update the lockfile:

```r
renv::snapshot()
```

Notes:
- Do NOT commit `renv/library/` (it is machine-specific and large). Only commit `renv.lock` and the `renv/` metadata files.

## Running Assignment 1

From the repo root in R:

```r
setwd("assignment1")
source("run_all.R")
```

Outputs are written to:
- `assignment1/data/processed/` (CSV files)
- `assignment1/figs/` (PNG figures)

If Quarto is installed, `run_all.R` also renders `assignment1/assignment1.qmd` to an HTML report.

## If you are NOT using `renv`

Install the packages used by Assignment 1:

```r
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "here", "patchwork", "knitr"))
```

(Quarto is typically installed as a separate application/CLI; if Quarto is not installed, you can still run the simulations and generate figures via `run_all.R`.)

## Repo structure (typical)

- `assignment1/` — Matching Pennies strategies + simulation + report
- `renv/`, `renv.lock` — reproducible R environment
- `ACM.Rproj` — RStudio project file

## Git hygiene

Recommended ignores in the root `.gitignore`:
- `.Rproj.user/`, `.Rhistory`, `.RData`, `.Ruserdata`
- `renv/library/`
- OS junk like `.DS_Store`
