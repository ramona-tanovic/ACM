# ACM (Advanced Cognitive Modelling)

This repository contains small, self-contained assignments for the course material from:
fusaroli.github.io/AdvancedCognitiveModeling2023/

Current content:
- `assignment1/`: Repeated Matching Pennies as a strategy tournament + Bayesian parameter story (Stan priors + Stan posterior fitting).

How to run
1. Open `ACM.Rproj` in RStudio (recommended), or open the folder as a project.
2. Go into `assignment1/` and follow the instructions in `assignment1/README.md`.

Notes
- Stan is used in two roles:
  (A) sampling heterogeneous agent parameters from explicit priors (fixed_param)
  (B) fitting an interpretable WSLS-style policy model to generated sequences (posterior inference)
